# govinfo-api-demo

Simple demo scripts for accessing the govinfo API via Python 3.x.

[govinfo_api_demo.py](/govinfo_api_demo.py) goes through a simple flow starting with the collections endpoint leading to a download of a specific file. There are obviously more complex functions that can be performed.
